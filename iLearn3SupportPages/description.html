<h2>Can I be a Good Programmer?</h2>
<p>Good programmers have some traits in common. They're 
  <ul>
    <li>creative, </li>
    <li>love to explore their environment, and</li>
    <li>consider helping and learning from others a joy.</li>
  </ul>
  A good programming course should allow you to explore and strengthen yourself in these three things. That course was designed to let this happen. In it, you will have many chances to be creative, explore your environment, and help and learn from others.
</p>
<p>
Based on what I've seen of students over the many years I've been teaching, there are a few common concerns students have. You may have these concerns too. Let's tackle them right now.
</p>
<ol>
<li><h3>I'm not creative.</h3>
  Yes--you are. You've just been told you aren't over and over. Being creative doesn't mean you can sit down and write a beautiful sonata, create an amazing painting, or write a great novel. It means you can recognize truth and use it to act on possiblities to solve problems you face. Creativity is part of your legacy as a child of God. It is one of the foundational characteristics of the eternal nature that is your true self. In the gospel it is part of what we call intellegence and intellegences.
</p>
<p>
  If you weren't creative, you would never have been able to learn to do even the simplest of tasks.
  <span class="bookTitle">You are creative!</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h3>I can't explore because I don't know what questions to ask.</h3>
<p>
  If you struggle with this, it's usually because you have been taught to try to guess the question your teacher wants you to ask; to ask what some would call smart questions. There are no smart or stupid questions. Stop trying to guess. Instead, learn to ask true questions. Whenever anyone starts doing something they haven't done before, they always must ask the most basic of questions. So where do these questions come from? They come from trying to do stuff. Notice I said "trying." Trying is different from succeeding. It usually means we try something and aren't completely successful at what we tried. We use this experience to ask ourselves and others questions about the experience.  Trying is where your questions will come from when you explore.<span class="bookTitle"> It doesn't matter what question you ask, only that you start asking. Any question will work to get you started.</span>
</p>
<p>
  Maybe there were some things you thought you understood but didn't. Maybe some explanation you started your exploration with didn't help you as much as you thought. Maybe you missunderstood something you heard or read. Maybe you have a preconcieved notion that is incorrect and you need to adjust it. There are a whole lot of reasons that trying yeilds failure, but failure is good. It means we can learn and grow from our experience. It is from these failures that we create our questions. Don't be afraid of failure! God doesn't expect you to be perfect so why would you expect perfection of yourself?
</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h3>I've tried helping and learning from others in a class and it didn't go well.</h3>
    <p>
      I've had this experience too. That's why so many of us hate working in teams. In school, the way most of your teamwork was graded made it so someone felt compeled to take control of the result and others felt justified in sitting back and doing little or nothing. This is not how professional teams work, at least not if the team's manager knows how to manage. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no team grades in this course. You will work in teams, but the team project won't get graded. Instead, you will be assessed as an individual. This the same way good managers assess the members of their teams.
    </p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where Next?</h2>
<p>
  So we've started dealing with a few common problems but that isn't where we should stop.
<span class="bookTitle">Elder Kerr, October 8, 2013 devotional</span> said,"I hope to have communicated to you the importance of viewing learning as a progressive process—that we not just learn 'about' something, but that we learn 'from' it—that learning is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is all about becoming the people we ought to be."
</p>
<p>In this class, you will be assessed on and given feedback regarding how well you are accomplishing Elder Kerr's definition of learning. You will be assessed not only on what you know and can do, but also on what you are becoming. Are you becoming more creative? are you becoming attuned to exploration? And also, are you becoming someone who enjoys helping, learning, and working with others? In other words, are you becoming a good programmer.
</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you career will be writing software, designing networks, designing databases, working as a project manager, or working in a completely different profession, you can use what you learn in this class. The three attributes of good programmers are actually the three attributes of any good professional. All three are used in everything human beings do to create meaningful music, art, buildings, highways, computer networks, or software. It's also how we become good neighbors.
