<h2>Class Structure</h2>
<p>
	Instead of being built around assignments, quizes and tests, this class is all about activities and assessments. You'll probably find this is dramatically different than classes you've had before.  
</p>
<p>
	Since you'll need to plan out your semester, here's a course map to help you out.

<h2>Activity Descriptions</h2>
<ol>
	<li><h3 class="class_exploration_text shadows">Class Learning and Exploration</h3>
		<p>
			This activity happens only once. During it you should read the provided books and resources to gain an understanding of the topics. Make sure you are reading to understand not just get through the book. Since you are new to programming, I'd think you'd need to ask me, your teacher, teammates, and classmates questions to understand what you're reading. You should also help out your mates. “…whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” Galations 6:7
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of this exploration, you should create all the examples in the book and get them working. Then, you should create examples of your own that illustrate these same principles. These examples will not be graded. To be of most use to you, you should discuss and ask questions about these examples with me, your teammates, and classmates. Use us as resources, but do your own thing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Doing your own thing means you haven't duplicated or modified what someone else did. Doing your own thing means you've stretched yourself. That you've applied what you've learned to your own life. Feel free to apply your creativity and make your examples fit something you enjoy doing. What are your hobbies? What do you have some level of expertise in? What do you have some experience with? Those are always good places to start when you're looking for problems you can solve and examples you can create.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3 class="personal_exploration_text shadows">Personal Exploration</h3>
		<p>
			This activity happens three times during the semester. For it you'll select three things you haven't yet done personal explorations for. Use your knowledge you gained in the Class Learning and Exploration activity to go deeper and broader in the three things you pick. During this time, Google will be your friend. Use it to search for how to's and other ideas. If you feel you need feedback on the choices you'll make, ask me, your teacher, and I'll be happy to help out. But don't ask me for what things you should explore. Instead, make some decisions and then ask me for ideas on how to make your ideas great. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Interact with your team. Use them as sounding boards. When you discover something neat, share it. Your ideas can trigger ideas in their heads. Talk. Share. That is most of what goes on when you're exploring. But be careful. Don't fall into the trap of duplicating/slightly modifying what they have found and claiming it as your own. That would be dishonest.
		</p>
		<p>
			You'll obviously want to play with what you've discovered. Make new examples or modify the examples you made in the Class Learning and Exploration activity. Have fun. Play around with this stuff. You've got two weeks for each of these activities.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3 class="team_challenge_text shadows">Team Challenge</h3>
		<p>
			This activity also happens three times during the semester. For it you'll come together as a team to overcome the challenge I, your teacher, give you. As a team, design and create a pleasing solution to the challenge. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here is the definition you should use.<br/>
			<dl>
			  <dt class="bookTitle">Pleasing:</dt>
			  <dd>Easy on the eye and mind. It looks good, the layout work well. It is easy to use and well organized.</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		<p>
			Go wild with these challenges. Think big. This is the time to show what you can do. Bring together all the stuff you've learned so far.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the end of each of these challenges you should request to be assessed against the outcomes. Take a look below to see what you should provide the instructor for this assessment.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Being Assessed</h2>
<p>
	Through your continual interactions with me as you do these activities, and by observing your on-going interactions with your team and classmates, I develop a deep understanding of your attainment of the outcomes. This understanding (assessment) is much deeper than a test or quize could give me. And the ongoing feedback you get is also much better than what you could get from a test or quiz. Use class time to get as much interaction with me as you possibly can. That is how you'll learn and grow the best.
</p>
<p>
	You trigger recording an assessment when you submit an assessment recording request.You</span> must have created this document yourself. The document lists each of the three topics you did for your personal exploration and must be written as if it was a letter. You must state you have completed any changes requested by me, your teacher, for each of the individual exploration examples. You must also provide evidence that you contributed significantly to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript created by your team to meet the challenge this assessment request is tied to.
</p>
<p>
	As part of this letter, you have an oportunity to have your attainment of the first three outcomes assessed. To do this, discuss how you are becoming or what you did to continue becoming outcomes 1, 2, and 3. It your responsibility to explain and express these well. It is not my responsibility to 'pull these out of you.'
</p>

<p> 
	As part of the assessemnt request, be the honest person you are. It will hurt you in life, your career, your salvation, and the class if you choose to deceive.
</p>
<p>
	Last of all, sign the letter digitally.
</p>
<p>
<h3>A Sample Assessment Request</h3>
</p>
<p>
	Brother Barney,<br>

	Previously I've shown you my personal exploration code for each of the following topics. I have made the changes you suggested and am now requesting an assessment be recorded for these three topics.
	<ul>
		<li>Representing Things in JavaScript</li>
		<li>Using CSS to change how Lists Look</li>
		<li>HTML Lists</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		For Representing Things in JavaScript, I ..... in my personal explorations and in the team challenge I ......
	</p>
	<p>
		For Using CSS to change how Lists Look, I ..... in my personal explorations but the team challenge didn't need lists.
	</p>
	<p>
		For HTML Lists, I ..... in my personal explorations but the team challenge didn't need them.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition to helping the team with Representing Things in the team challenge, I helped work on the CSS and HTML. I contributed the .....parts that did.....
	</p>
	<p>
		I also am providing you evidence of my becoming as described in the 'Being Successful by being Assessed' portion of the course description and in the course rubric.

	<ol>
	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">becoming more dexterous at exploring your environment:</span> - When I began exploring HTML, I found out it has a couple of different kinds of things called lists. I started wondering.... </li>
	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">becoming more efficient at recognizing and applying your innate curiosity and creativity:</span> - When I saw how to create lists I started wondering....</li>
	<li>
		<span class="bookTitle">becoming a person who enjoys helping and learning from others</span> - Here is a <a>link to a Google+ hangout where I am teaching my team about some of the things I've learned. You can hear me teaching at the 3:20 time stamp in the video.</li>

	</ol>
</p>

<p>
	Thank you. 
	<br>Signed,
	<br>
	<br>

<h3>Professional Empathy</h3>
<p>
	When you write this letter, put yourself in my shoes (In programming we call this having professional empathy). Am I going to be able to fully remember and understand what you've done based on your explanation? If not, you may need to be more explicit.
</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, have you been too explicit? Are there things you've included that don't need to be there? If there are, remove them and reword what you've written.
</p>
