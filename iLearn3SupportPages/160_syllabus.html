<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	This course is designed to allow you to become more professional by learning in an environment where the instructor is your mentor rather than a lecturer. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you will learn to explore technologies in order to resolve problems that arise naturally. You will also learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those same problems through creating an single page mobile web application. Having had such a mentored learning experience is very important when you begin your career. Exploration to solve previously unsoved problems is what you will be doing for your job.
