<h1 class="centered">Course Structure</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	This course is designed to help you become more professional by learning in an environment where the instructor is your mentor rather than a lecturer. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you will explore technologies and use them to resolve problems that arise naturally. You will also learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those same problems through creating web pages.
</p>

<p>
	You will be working in groups but responsible for your own learning. This is encoraged by evaluating your learning, not the team's. To accomplish this, assessment points have been created for the course. These consist of personal explorations and team challenges. You can see what these are and how your they will be assessed by viewing the course rubric.
</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>
	By taking advantage of the opportunities this course presents, you will develop fundamental knowledge and skills in computing and technology and improve your professional possibilities by
</p>

		</li>
		<li>
			becoming more dexterous at exploring your environment,
		</li>
		<li>
			becoming a person who enjoys helping and learning from others,
		</li>
		<li>

		</li> 
		<li>
			writing and evaluating compound boolean expressions,
		</li>
		<li>
			using a divide and conquer approach, segmentation, to design solutions for programming solutions to problems,
		</li>
		<li>
			finding and trouble shooting bugs you and others will have in the computer code you write, and
		</li>
		<li>
			developing and debugging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript computer programs that use the basic programming control structures known as sequence, selection, and repetition along with functions, and arrays.
		</li>

	</div>

These outcomes support both <a href="http://yenrab.github.io/doing_more_with_java/iLearn3SupportPages/universityandcitoutcomes.pdf">the CIT Department and BYU-Idaho student learning outcomes.</a>

The activities and assessments for this course are designed to give you opportunities to achieve these outcomes and assess you against them. If you desire a different set of assessments and assignments, you may propose them (during the first or second week of the semester) to the instructor but your proposal must cover ALL of the course's outcomes in significant ways and to a significant depth. Do not propose a "check list" of do-once and forget activities. These will not be approved.

<h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
<h3>Prepare:</h3>
Each week you will work directly with your team outside of class time. You help your team become successful if you come prepared for these team meetings. You should come having thought about the technologies you are exploring or the design of your team solution to a team challenge, completed assignments given during the previous meeting, and having done the necessary research to plan the next steps for your team. Just as in life, if you do more than fulfill minimum requirements assigned to you, you will be more successful in your team and in the class. Magnify your professional calling.
<h3>Teach One Another:</h3>
Team meetings and a collaborative environment have been established to enable each of you to draw from the strengths of others so that your weaknesses can become strengths. This requires effort on the part of both the knower and the learner 'so that both may be edified.'
<h3>Ponder/Prove:</h3>
<p>
	Pondering is integral to success in both this course and life. You should be pondering and reflecting not only on what you are learning but how. Self-knowledge is vital to professional life. It is also fundimental to our exaltation.
</p>
<p>
	Proving is also integral to success. You should prove what you think you know through experimentation. Just finding an example of some principle on the web or from your team is insufficient for successful learning. You should be playing with and generating your own examples to understand how technologies work and what they do. This way you become a blessing to yourself and your current and future team members.
</p>
